#Trial 2 Count function
#
# Convert trial by trial experimental information for N trials into response counts.
#
# INPUTS
# stimID:   1xN vector. stimID(i) = 0 --> stimulus on i'th trial was S1.
#                       stimID(i) = 1 --> stimulus on i'th trial was S2.
#
# response: 1xN vector. response(i) = 0 --> response on i'th trial was "S1".
#                       response(i) = 1 --> response on i'th trial was "S2".
#
# rating:   1xN vector. rating(i) = X --> rating on i'th trial was X.
#                       X must be in the range 1 <= X <= nRatings.
#
# nRatings: total # of available subjective ratings available for the
#           subject. e.g. if subject can rate confidence on a scale of 1-4,
#           then nRatings = 4
#
# padAmount: if set to 1, each response count in the output has the value of
#          1/(2*nRatings) added to it. This is desirable if trial counts of
#          0 interfere with model fitting.
#          if set to 0, trial counts are not manipulated and 0s may be
#          present. default value is 0.
# padCells: Putts padAmount into function. default value is 0.
#
# OUTPUTS
# newlist which contains nR_S1 & nR_S2
# these are vectors containing the total number of responses in
# each response category, conditional on presentation of S1 and S2.
#
# e.g. if nR_S1 = [100 50 20 10 5 1], then when stimulus S1 was
# presented, the subject had the following response counts:
# responded S1, rating=3 : 100 times
# responded S1, rating=2 : 50 times
# responded S1, rating=1 : 20 times
# responded S2, rating=1 : 10 times
# responded S2, rating=2 : 5 times
# responded S2, rating=3 : 1 time
#
# EXAMPLE
# stimID =    list(0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1)
# response =  list(0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1)
# rating =    list(1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1)
# nRatings = 4
# newlist = trials2counts(stimID,response,rating,nRatings)
# print(newlist)
